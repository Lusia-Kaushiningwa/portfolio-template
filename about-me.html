            <p>I am Lusia. A passionate beginner full-stack developer.</p>
            <p>I am a curious and driven developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, functional, and visually appealing web experiences. My journey into tech started with a simple curiosity about how websites work, and quickly turned into a passion for building them myself. </p>
            <p class="quote uppercase center"><span class="colorful-letter">Growth happens when curiosity </span> meets consistency.</p>
            <p>I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and constantly improving my skills. Every project I build represents progress — not just in coding, but in creativity, structure, and confidence.</p>

            <h2 class="main-title-large center">How it all started...</h2>
            <p>My journey into development began when I decided to understand what happens “behind the screen.” What started as simple HTML experiments quickly grew into learning CSS layouts, JavaScript logic, and building full interactive pages from scratch.</p>
            <p class="italic">- It started with curiosity and a lot of trial and error.</p>
            <p>In the beginning, I faced challenges understanding positioning, responsiveness, and JavaScript logic. But every bug I solved strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me patience. Instead of giving up, I learned how to research, test solutions, and improve step by step.</p>

           <p>That mindset is what truly shaped me as a developer.</p>

                    I am also exploring structured learning programs through respected online platforms to strengthen my foundation and gain deeper  <span

                    Currently, I am working on two ongoing projects: <span class="bold uppercase colorful-letter">two ongoing projects</span>.
                    One project focuses on building a more advanced web application with dynamic data handling and improved UI/UX design.
                    The second project involves improving my previous applications by refactoring the code, optimizing performance, and applying better development practices.
                </li>
                <li class="no-padding-list-item">
                    Both projects aim to strengthen my real-world development skills and prepare me for professional opportunities.
                     <span class="bold">One achievement I am proud of is building complete web applications independently — from idea to deployment. The most important concepts I have encountered so far include responsive design, DOM manipulation, reusable components, structured code organization, and clean UI principles.</span>.
